1. **Install Dependencies**

    You need to install additional dependencies according to your OS version as guided [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net80#additional-deps).

    For Windows 7, the following additional dependencies are required:

    - Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable [64-bit](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) / [32-bit](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

2. **Address Memory Leak Issues**

    .NET 7 and above runtimes cause serious memory leak issues on Windows 7. You need to run the following commands in the command prompt as an administrator to fix this:

    ```shell
    setx DOTNET_GCName clrgc.dll
    setx DOTNET_EnableWriteXorExecute 0
    ```

    The above commands set the following environment variables. If the commands fail, you can manually set the following variables.
    
    | Environment Variable | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | [`DOTNET_GCName`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22DOTNET_GCName%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fquyilin%2FProjects%2Fclassisland-docs-next%2Fsrc%2Fen-us%2Fapp%2Fsetup.md%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fquyilin%2FProjects%2Fclassisland-docs-next%2Fsrc%2Fen-us%2Fapp%2Fsetup.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fquyilin%2FProjects%2Fclassisland-docs-next%2Fsrc%2Fen-us%2Fapp%2Fsetup.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A34%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") | [`clrgc.dll`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22clrgc.dll%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fquyilin%2FProjects%2Fclassisland-docs-next%2Fsrc%2Fen-us%2Fapp%2Fsetup.md%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fquyilin%2FProjects%2Fclassisland-docs-next%2Fsrc%2Fen-us%2Fapp%2Fsetup.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fquyilin%2FProjects%2Fclassisland-docs-next%2Fsrc%2Fen-us%2Fapp%2Fsetup.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A34%2C%22character%22%3A23%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") |

### About .NET 6 Compatible Version
In order for ClassIsland to run on lower versions of Windows 10, we made .NET 6 Compatible Version. This compatible version will be synced from time to time with the upstream main repository. You can view the compatible version of the repository [here](https://github.com/ClassIsland/ClassIsland-net6/).

The following features are not available in Compatible Version:

- Plugins

## Extract the Software

After downloading, extract the software package to an **independent folder (the path cannot contain Chinese characters [^2])** and run the software to start using it.

Do not extract to a cloud sync folder or the [Downloads] folder, as this may cause **file read/write issues or file loss**.

::: tip
This software will store all configurations in this folder. After configuration, you can directly take this folder to school for use.
